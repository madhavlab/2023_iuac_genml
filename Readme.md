# Generative Machine Learning for Particle and Statistical Physics
## By Vipul Arora and Ankur Singha

### Presentation:
- [presentation.pdf](presentation.pdf) contains the tutorial slides.
- Contents:
  - Probability density functions and sampling
  - Transformation of random variables
  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for sampling
  - Rejection Sampling
  - Iterative Sampling Methods: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
  - Metropolis Hastings (MH) algorithm
  - Normalizing Flow (NF)

### Codes:
- [Codes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-eGIPmvYhPzLIider7r-RWl4bhx8G1D0?usp=drive_link) are available here.
- These implement MCMC (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) method and Normalizing Flow method for scalar field theory or $\phi^4$ theory.
